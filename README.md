# Clojure Web Development Essentials - hipstr

Hey, cool, you cloned the source repo for the Clojure Web Development Essentials hub! That means somebody actually bought my book! Rad. Thank you!

In this repo you'll find all the source code that accompanies the book. Throughout the writing, and thus the development of the book's content a branch will be made for each chapter. Upon final draft, all branches will be merged into the trunk, and tagged appropriately. 

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed. Other than that you should be pretty much set, as this application doesn't do anything crazy.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
